Fortunately, it&rsquo;s an easy DIY project that can be completed in a few hours, even if you&rsquo;re not a well-practiced handyman. In this post, we&rsquo;ll focus on the best install practices, and minor details to keep in mind while completing this task.</p><p>Perhaps you&rsquo;re frustrated with the dull countertop shadows? Or, do you find yourself hacking away with a dull knife to see if you&rsquo;re chopping food finely enough? Whatever your struggles may be, under cabinet lighting may offer an easy solution. Proper lighting can help reduce shadows and illuminate the workspaces, enhancing visibility significantly. Additionally, under cabinet LED lighting can transform the overall outlook of your kitchen, adding style and sophistication to space.</p><p>While under cabinet LED lighting may look daunting, the truth is that it&rsquo;s a reasonably simple process that anyone can accomplish. All it takes is a few tools, patience, and an eye for detail. Start by detaching the fixtures from their power sources and clearing out the area beneath the cabinets. Next, measure the space, select the appropriate LED light strip color and intensity, and install the strips according to manufacturer instructions. Once the strips are in place, connect them to the power source, and voila! You have just installed your very own under cabinet LED lighting.</p><p>In summary, it&rsquo;s essential to take the right steps while installing LED under cabinet lighting. Always prime the area before installation, measure twice, cut once, use the correct LED strip length, cord, and intensity and always follow the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions.</p><h2 id="how-to-install-under-cabinet-led-lighting-for-a-modern-look">How to Install Under Cabinet LED Lighting for a Modern Look</h2><p>Are you tired of the same boring and dull looking kitchen? Our home is where we relax and unwind, and it is natural to want everything to look beautiful and modern. As someone who wanted a fresh and classy look for my kitchen, I researched some quick and simple DIY projects. Out of the various options, LED under cabinet lighting offered the most appeal. With this easy step-by-step guide, you can complete the project all on your own, without spending much.</p><p>The first step is to gather tools and materials such as tape measure, light strips, a power supply, wire connectors, and spring clamps. Plan the installation based on your countertops&rsquo; length and width, often under-counter lights come in 12" or 24" lengths. Once you have a purchased LED strips with an adhesive backing, measure the cabinet&rsquo;s length where you intend to install them. Cut the LED strip&rsquo;s length according to your cabinet&rsquo;s measurement and stick the adhesive backing to the surface.</p><p><img loading="lazy" width="100%" src="https://howtoinstall1.netlify.app/img/placeholder.svg" data-src="http://blog.inspiredled.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/backcablighting-300x130.jpg" alt="Under cabinet LED Lighting" title="Under cabinet LED Lighting" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://howtoinstall1.netlify.app/img/placeholder.svg"' class="center">We recommend that you remove the protective layer from the adhesive side slowly to avoid surface damage. Most LED lighting brands include clips to help you secure the LED wires at various points. Once you have installed all the LED strips and secured the wires in place, connect them to a power source. Turn on the light, and voila! Enjoy a modern, beautiful addition to your kitchen.</p><h2 id="learn-about-color-temperature-and-adjusting-brightness">Learn about Color Temperature and Adjusting Brightness</h2><p>Choosing the correct color temperature and brightness can significantly impact your kitchen&rsquo;s overall outlook. Having multiple levels of control gives you flexibility while preparing food, dining, or even entertaining guests. We recommend a color temperature of 2700k for a warm light effect, and 4000k for a cool blueish tone can give your kitchen a modern look. Whether you have warm or cool-toned cabinets, selecting the wrong one can make the room look dull.</p><p>Adjusting the brightness is another useful factor to consider. Ensure you measure the brightness in lumens as it offers an essential factor in terms of lamp efficiency. The higher the lumens, the brighter your LED light fixture will be.</p><h3 id="protecting-the-led-light-strips">Protecting the LED Light Strips</h3><p>Once you have installed the LED light strips, it would be best to protect them from any moisture, dust, or other harmful elements. One of the best practices is to install LED Strip Diffuser or LED Extrusion to protect the LED light strips. This protects the LED strips from dust and other harmful elements and increases their lifespan, meaning you’ll save on maintenance costs too.</p><h4 id="choosing-the-right-power-supply-and-accessories">Choosing the Right Power Supply and Accessories</h4><p>When choosing the power supply and other accessories needed for your under cabinet LED lighting, ensure you go for high quality and long-lasting products to save on replacement costs. Check the voltage and ampere rating of the items. Always ensure you take all the necessary precautions when dealing with electricity, such as wearing gloves, turning off the main power supply, and handling electronics with care.</p><h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h2 id="conclusion-of-how-to-install-under-cabinet-led-lighting"><strong>Q:</strong> How long do LED lights last for under cabinet lighting?<br><strong>A:</strong> LED lights can last for over 50,000 hours, which means that you&rsquo;ll only need to replace them every five to ten years, depending on how frequently you use them.<br><strong>Q:</strong> Can I install LED under cabinet lighting without professional help?<br><strong>A:</strong> Yes, installing LED under cabinet lighting is an easy DIY project that any homeowner can accomplish without professional help.<br><strong>Q:</strong> What kind of LED lights should I use for under cabinet lighting?<br><strong>A:</strong> LED lighting strips are perfect for under cabinet lighting because they are thin, flexible, and easy to install.
